    <p>Description: "<strong><a href="mystic messenger.jpg">Mystic Messenger</a></strong>" (also known as <strong>수상한메신저</strong>) is a female-oriented otome Korean mobile game. <br> 
        It allows player (Y/N) to interact with all the charaters by sending messages to them in chatrooms and DMs. <br> 
        What the special is, the chatrooms open and phone calls are made in a specific time, following the actual time sets in your phone.  
        So players have to join in a specific time before the it expires.  Some even open at the midnights, which reminds me the days 
        that I have to set alarms so I will not miss any conversations with these characters.  <br>
        Each storyline last 11 days, which the common route (which is also the route that decide which character route 
        player enters by getting the most interest from.) There are different storylines as you can only get in certain characters' route, 
        which they are: <br></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Casual Story: Yoosung, Zen, Jaehee</li>
        <li>Deep Story: 707, Jumin</li>
        <li>Another Story: V, Ray</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The story will be different from the choices you made, leading to Normal Endings, Bad Endings, and <strong>Happy Ending</strong>.<br>
        During the time playing multiple times through those 11 days, dozen decisions made by player and the characters, and you will slowly 
        find the characters' attractive points and the whole depressing story behind the joyful chatroom.  <br>
        I am inspired so much by the game with the vivid plots and 
        somehow these characters are already becomes <strong>REAL</strong> in my head.<br> <br>
        FMI, my favourite character is 707.  <strong>My Ipad and Google wallpaper is him for like 5 years, I am being REAL  ;</strong>
